# Adyen [Shopware 6 Plugin](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/shopware-6) integration demo for support teams

In this demo, you can spin up a Shopware instance and install the Adyen Payment plugin to see how an integration works. It gives your shoppers the option to pay with their preferred payment method in a seamless checkout experience. You can try this demo both online or locally on your computer.

## Running online with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

* Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
* Go to [gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables) and set the `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` variables. Additionally, set the `SHOPWARE_PLUGIN_VERSION` to the desired [plugin version](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-shopware6/tags) for installation (e.g., `3.11.0`, scope: adyen-examples/*).
* Click the button below and wait for the "Unable to find a matching sales channel for the request" message to appear in the preview panel.
